# Cplusplus-Program | Project 1: Chada Tech dual clock

• Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The project required creating a program to display two clocks next to each other, one displaying the time in 12-hour format, and the other in 24-hour format. The main goal was to meet the international standard ISO 8601 and allow the visitors of my client's website to visualize the time in 12 and 24-hour formats.

• What did you do particularly well?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building a program that solved the problem of my client effectively and consistently was the bare minimum, and I focused on writing a program that was visually pleasant for their users, but also clean and easy to read for who needed to access the code to maintain it.

• Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I should improve the validation system by including the handling of non-numeric input to prevent the program from failing if the user entered a letter or special character: skilled developers should always anticipate unexpected user behavior. It would also be beneficial to add a Clock class to condense logic and time behavior and avoid redundant code.

• Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The most challenging and fun part has been to handle the time conversion paying attention to the noon/midnight edge cases (I lost the count of how many times I tested 11:59:59..). I didn't have particular trouble writing this program, I probably spent more time looking for visually pleasing unicode characters than on the actual coding, but I kept the ZyBook always open on my second monitor to help me with proper syntax and logic. I used AI mainly to ensure that my program met the project requirements. I didn't need to ask for help on any forums like Stack Overflow, but I am aware of how helpful AI tools can be at any stage of programming, and how valuable internet forums are when challenges arise.

• What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
